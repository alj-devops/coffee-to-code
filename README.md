# Coffee to Code website challenge

1.  On the "Types of Coffee" page, there are blocks that show the different coffee types with a description of the coffee. We would like to create separate pages for each coffee type so that it will be easier to add more information about each coffee type later. Please create a new page called "coffee-info" for each coffee type under the route "/coffee-types", for example: "/coffee-types/cafe-au-lait". Feel free to style the coffee-info pages how you like, mostly keeping to the overall design, but show off your creativity and add some of your own custom flair (i.e. styling, images...)!

2.  Next, we want to modify the coffee-types page to just show a snippet of the description showing the first two lines of text from the coffee description. Add a "Read more" link that links to the coffee-info pages built in step #1. The rest of the description text can be read on the coffee-info page.

3.  After you have finished steps #1 and #2, create your own coffee page for your favorite coffee (or other drink if you don't drink coffee :)). Make sure that your new coffee page gets listed on the "Types of Coffee" page with the other coffees.

4.  (BONUS) Make the "Code to Coffee" website fully responsive so that it can be viewed properly on smart phones.

Please feel free to make any other improvements to any of the code that you feel is necessary.

Don't hesitate to ask questions!
